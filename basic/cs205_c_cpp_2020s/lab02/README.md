## CS205_C_CPP_Lab02

1. Write a program to produce the output as shown below:

``` log
Result:
x value y value  Expressions     Result
10 |    5 |      x=y+3           |x=8   
10 |    5 |      x=y-2           |x=3   
10 |    5 |      x=y*5           |x=25  
10 |    5 |      x=x/y           |x=2   
10 |    5 |      x=x%y           |x=0   
```

2. Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of seconds as an integer value (use type long ,or,if
   available, long long ) and that then displays the equivalent time in days,hours,minutes,and seconds.Use symbolic
   constants to represent the number of hours in the day,the number of minutes in an hour,and the number of seconds in a
   minute.The output should look like this:

``` log
Input:
    31600000
Output:
    31600000 seconds = 365 days, 17 hours, 46minutes, 40seconds
```

3. Write a CPP program that asks the user enter One integer value, character, and a float value. And then we use the
   printf statement to print them out. A sample run should look like this:

``` log
Input: 
    Z,1926,8.17
Output:  
    Z,1926,8.17.
```
