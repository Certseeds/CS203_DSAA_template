# CS205_C_CPP_Lab01

1. Write a program to print your name and address
2. Many studies suggest that smiling has benefits. Write a program that produces the following output:

``` log
Smile!Smile!Smile!
Smile!Smile!
Smile!
```

Have the program `define a function` that displays the string `Smile!` once, and have the program use the function as
often as needed.
