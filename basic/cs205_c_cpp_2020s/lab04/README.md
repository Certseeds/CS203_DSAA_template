## CS205_C_CPP_Lab04

1. William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service.For each pizza,he needs to record the following information:

+ The name of the pizza company,which can consist of more than one word
+ The diameter of the pizza
+ The weight of the pizza

Devise a structure that can hold this information and Write a program that use new to allocate a structure instead of
declaring a structure variable of that type.The program should ask the user to enter each of the preceding items of
information,and then the program should display that information.

2. The **CandyBar** structure contains **three** members.The first member holds the brand **name** of a candy bar.The
   second member holds the **weight** (which may have a fractional part) of the candy bar, and the third member holds **
   the number of calories** (an integer value) in the candy bar.

Write a program that use **new** to allocate the array dynamically of three CandyBar, The program ask the user to enter
each of the preceding items of information,and then the program should display that information.

3. Write a C++ program to accept five integer values from keyword:

+ The five values will be stored in an array using a pointer.
+ print the elements of the array in reverse order using a pointer
