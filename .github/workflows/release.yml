# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: test and release

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on: 
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  test:
    name: test for release
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - name: checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # ensure the path and files of project
    - name: ensure the path and files of project
