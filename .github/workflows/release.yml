# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: test and release

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on: 
  push:

jobs:
  test:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
